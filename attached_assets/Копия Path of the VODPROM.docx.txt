Belarus is presenting Culligan in the countries of the Customs Union
On November 15, 2012, during the VII Belarusian Investment Forum, in the presence of First Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus Vladimir SEMASHKO, an agreement was officially signed on the implementation of an investment project to organize the production of water purification equipment by the international company Culligan on the territory of Belarus.
Lawrence BAUER, Senior Vice President of Culligan, and Tim Mackintosh, Head of Nova International Management investment company, specially arrived in Minsk for the signing ceremony. As a result of the agreement, the company "Culligan Bel" was founded in Belarus, which now represents the interests of Culligan in Belarus and the countries of the Customs Union.


After the signing of the official agreement on the implementation of the Culligan investment project, the work on its execution began to boil with triple force. It was decided to locate the production facilities of the Belarusian enterprise in Zaslavl (Minsk region), where according to the project development plans, an assembly shop is operating, and all stages of the production of Culligan equipment will also be located.
 Culligan_2 

Tim Mackintosh, Head of Nova International Management Investment Company, Lawrence BAUER, Senior Vice President of Culligan, and Artem KUCHEROV, Director of Culligan Bel LLC
As representatives of Culligan commented, Culligan Bel LLC is authorized to manufacture products under the Culligan brand, monitor the use of Culligan's patented equipment at facilities, provide assistance and technical support to partners and customers of the company in Belarus and the countries of the Customs Union.  "Culligan Bel" is also ready to promote the dissemination of experience in the field of water treatment, taking into account international quality standards and energy saving.
From Italy to Belarus
As many experts have already recognized, the implementation of this large-scale project is an absolute breakthrough for Belarus. The main goal of the project is to transfer part of Culligan's production facilities from Italy, where the main production is now concentrated to Belarus. The production of products under the brand name of Culligan is being established in the country using the company's patented and world-famous technologies. To do this, foreign partners have transferred their technical know-how to colleagues from Belarus. The quality of manufactured products and their compliance with international standards is controlled by specialists of the company's head office.
All this will allow Belarusian producers to adequately compete in the market of the Single Economic Space. The manufactured equipment will be able to be used for the needs of the food industry, medicine, agriculture and housing and communal services in Belarus, as well as supplied to the countries of the Customs Union, the CIS and Western Europe.
The project is in three stages
The implementation of the Culligan project in Belarus takes place in several stages. To begin with, the assembly production of an extensive line of Culligan equipment for water treatment from both imported and domestic components has been organized. This equipment will be used for the needs of the Belarusian market.
At the second stage of the project (it is planned to start next year), in addition to the assembly of ready-made components, a full-fledged local production of a wide range of Culligan equipment will be organized. It is planned to produce pressure tanks with anti-corrosion coating using Culligan's patented technology, hydraulic mixers, pipe strapping elements and other equipment with bringing the level of localization of production to 40-60%.
The possibility of organizing production in addition to the main equipment of filter materials and reagents is also being considered. These products will be used for the needs of the Belarusian market, as well as exported to the countries of the Customs Union.


To whom will the Culligan project help?
One of the most popular areas of Culligan's work in Belarus is expected to be the manufacture of water treatment equipment for its use by housing and communal services organizations. This is not surprising, because Culligan equipment is operated at municipal water intakes in almost all European countries.
For example, since 1999, the Culligan water purification equipment has been equipped with the city water utility in Ashgabat (Turkmenistan), where the daily volume of purified water is 150 thousand m3, and the Culligan equipment completely purifies the water to a drinking state and eliminates turbidity from it. One of the largest clients of Culligan is also the Department of Water Management of Porto (Portugal), where about 170 thousand m3 of water is cleaned daily.аможенного союза.
 =D1=84=D0=BE=D1=82=D0=BE 

It was also decided to direct a significant part of the Belarusian production to the manufacture of specialized equipment for water purification at food processing enterprises (including dairy industry), in agriculture (including dairy farms), in medical institutions, at sports facilities (in swimming pools, ice palaces, sports complexes, etc.), in the hotel industry, in the energy sector.
In addition, Culligan, having experience in the modernization of production facilities, has already offered a number of the largest domestic enterprises promising investment modernization projects using world technologies that have already proven themselves in the market and are successfully used at many European enterprises. This cooperation will save billions of rubles of budget funds, that is especially important for the country now, in the Year of Thrift.
 And what about us?
The largest Belarusian enterprises have already tested Culligan water treatment technology in practice.
Today, Culligan equipment and technologies are already being used at a number of the largest housing and communal services enterprises in the country. For example, at the water intakes "Brilevo" in Kobrin (25 thousand m3/day), "Dubrovnya" in Lida (24 thousand m3/day), "Volhva" in Baranovichi (20 thousand m3/day), at the city water intake in Luninets (7 thousand m3/day).
Food industry enterprises, such as the Berezovsky Cheese Factory, Luninetsky Dairy Plant, Pinsky Winery, "Savushkin Product", "Babushkina Krynka", "Belovezhsky Cheeses", "Molochnye Gorki", also relied on Culligan equipment during the modernization of their production facilities.
Culligan's partners in Belarus are RUE "Gomeltransneft Druzhba", the Capital Construction Department of the Stolinsky District Executive Committee. One of the iconic sports facilities where Culligan equipment was installed is the "Minsk Arena".

Culligan provides drinking water to residents of Slonim
The iron content in the water exceeds the norm by 5 times, manganese - by 2 times.  Water with such characteristics was supplied to residential houses of residents of Slonim. The city needed an urgent project to modernize the central water supply, which was proposed by Culligan.
The construction of the "Podgornaya Dacha" water intake station in Slonim required solving the issue of the maximum permissible concentrations of metals in artesian water. The new de-ironing station allowed not only to solve this problem, but also to significantly save occupied space.
Back in 2013, Culligan launched a special configuration of Twin filters, which allowed for high-quality water purification without additional bulky pumping equipment for flushing filters. The ultra-compactness of the Culligan filters allows the equipment of the degreasing station to be placed on small areas. Due to full automation, maintenance personnel are not required at the station.

The service life of Culligan filter materials is at least 25 years, and the case itself is at least 50 years. This means that the station can work for at least 25 years without replacing the load.
At the moment, the capacity of the degreasing station is 15,000 m3/day. Culligan equipment allows you to purify water from iron, manganese, turbidity, color to existing standards. The volume of washing water is 73 m3/day.
Water analyses in different parts of the city have shown that the iron content has significantly decreased, water quality has improved, rusty plaque has gone from the pipes. The proof of the high-quality work of the de-ironing station "Podgornaya Station" with Culligan equipment was positive feedback from residents of the city about the quality of water from the central water supply system.

The economic climate created in Belarus should contribute to the inflow of investments and strengthen the country's image in the international arena. This statement was made by the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting with the heads of diplomatic missions and consular offices on July 17, 2014.
It is not often possible to see all the ambassadors at once in one place. Diplomats return to their homeland every two years in order, as they themselves say, to check their watches, adjust their work and, of course, get an assessment of the activities of their embassy, including from the Head of State. Over 20 years of sovereignty, Belarus has opened its representative offices in 106 countries. And continues to expand the geography of its presence.
The main tasks for embassies and consulates are to achieve a positive balance in trade, to find new trade routes and markets. In modern conditions, when major players in the international arena use force methods, pressure and raw material trumps, Belarus will need non-standard solutions.
Culligan Investment Project
Belarus, according to the President, has learned to resist powerful external pressure and implement bold projects, whether it is hosting the Ice Hockey World Cup, after which, no doubt, many states have looked at Belarus with different eyes, or the construction of a nuclear power plant, the appearance of which haunts some foreign politicians.
Two years ago, when appointing Vladimir Makei to the post of Foreign Minister, the President set the task for the diplomatic corps to increase exports by any means. How enterprises will work in foreign markets is a key factor in the economic stability of the country and a kind of assessment of the professional suitability of diplomats.
According to the President, not enough attention is still paid to the export of services, in many countries this area is almost the main part of budget revenue. The issue of the shortage of effective managers at state-owned enterprises remains acute, although there are enough certified specialists in the country.
The development of exports requires the creation of a large-scale foreign economic infrastructure, ranging from port terminals, the construction of transport and logistics centers to the optimization of commodity networks. All this requires considerable investment.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently introduced the practice of personal responsibility. This year, the ambassadors are assigned 34 major investment projects totaling about $ 4 billion. One of the successful examples of this project is the example of Culligan.
The President also noted the importance of maintaining positions in traditional markets - in Russia, where half of Belarusian exports go, and Ukraine, with which, despite the tragic events and the pro-European orientation of the new leadership, a high trade turnover remains. And the introduction of a special duty for Belarusian exporters by Kiev on the eve, according to the Ambassador of Belarus to Ukraine, is rather an emotional decision. In order not to be followed by economic consequences, the parties intend to settle the issue in the near future. Thanks to the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, Belarus has more chances to promote its goods outside the Customs Union, to the countries of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Europe.
The Foreign Minister drew attention to what is called "translation difficulties" – when people who do not speak a foreign language work in trade missions abroad (through which 30% of exports pass). Not to mention the unnecessarily bloated staff. However, the Prime Minister has questions about the professional level and efficiency of the ambassadors themselves.
Another important vector is building strategic relations with each country. Economy, trade and diplomacy," the President noted, "should become synonymous words, and the conversation should take place along the lines of "it is beneficial for both you and us."

Culligan – that's what we should look up to
"The American corporation Culligan, which holds 40% of the world's water purification equipment. And they came to us to build a factory here. Hence, the climate is normal. That's what we should look up to," President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at a meeting with heads of diplomatic missions and consular offices in July 2014.

The first Belarusian-American Investment Forum was held in New York
In September 2014, the Belarusian delegation took part in a number of events in New York (USA), the most high-profile of which was the first Belarusian-American investment forum. Within the framework of the forum, meetings were held with representatives of the US Congress, the IMF, the World Bank, bilateral business meetings, and a large-scale presentation was held in the center of the financial capital of the world — in Manhattan.
The first event of this scale between the Belarus-USA countries was held with the participation of representatives of the US State Department and senior officials of the Belarusian state apparatus. The interest in the forum from the American business was great: representatives of almost 200 American companies applied to participate in it.

Trade and economic relations between the USA and Belarus have been going through different times. There were years of recovery, and there was a decline in recent years. The annual trade turnover of a billion dollars is incomparably small compared to the opportunities that both countries have. 667,000 dollar millionaires live or work in New York. From each of their millions, if they put it in a bank, they can receive no more than a year 5 000 — 7 000 dollars. Money should work, everyone understands this here, and therefore the Belarusian delegation was met with great interest in promising cooperation.
The organizers divided the forum program into 3 parts, thus identifying the main priorities: investment, IT and science, trade. Belarusian ministers, our and American businessmen, but the Prime Minister begins the presentation.
Both countries have excellent starting opportunities for building new economic relations. The USA is one of the leading investors in Belarus: several hundred joint ventures are operating, a joint Business Cooperation Council has been established. What is missing is a full-fledged contractual and legal framework. This is the first thing they are working on now. Soon, three agreements will be released at once: on mutual protection and promotion of investments, on avoidance of double taxation and on legal assistance
. 21231 
One of the highlights of the forum was the working meeting of the Prime Minister of Belarus Mikhail Myasnikovich with the President of the International Multinational Corporation Culligan Scott Clawson.
Culligan has already implemented a number of successful projects in Belarus. For example, the Corporation has installed water treatment systems at Minsk water intakes, Culligan equipment is installed at certain strategic facilities of the country. The main advantage noted by business owners in Belarus is savings on capital expenditures (during the construction of facilities there is no need to allocate large areas for the installation of water treatment equipment), European quality of cleaning and a variety of certificates of conformity that allow you to work in any market.
Within the framework of the forum, a new agreement was signed on the activities of the Culligan Corporation in Belarus — Belarus (Zaslavl) will become the center of the Eurasian direction of Culligan.
Scott Clawson, President of Culligan International: "Our main interest was simple - the production of products in Belarus and their sale for export. And not only to the countries of the Customs Union. And I am happy that we have such an opportunity."
David Baron, Co-Chairman of the Belarus-USA Business Cooperation Council: "Belarus is of interest to American business from the perspective of investment prospects. You have qualified personnel, favorable geographical location, access to the huge Eurasian market. Believe me, American business is interested in any opportunity to establish a good cooperation that would be successful and, of course, profitable." 


For reference
From the point of view of business statistics, Belarus and the USA are partner countries. In 2013, the joint trade turnover amounted to almost $ 700 million. Moreover, Belarusian exports have grown by a quarter over the year. Another $235 million was brought to Belarusian companies by sales of services in the United States.

Construction of a plant in Zaslavl - Culligan in Belarus
Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei met with Vice President of Culligan Corporation Lawrence Bauer on February 3. This was reported in the press service of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry.
During the working meeting, the parties discussed the prospects of creating in Belarus not only the assembly, but also the full-scale production site to cover the needs of the Customs Union countries in products in the field of water treatment. production in Zaslavl (Belarus) will become the third facility where Culligan equipment is manufactured.
Culligan's production facilities are located all over the world - USA (Illinois), Italy (Bologna). Belarus is currently joining this list, which will become the center of Eurasian production.

The construction in Belarus of its own production of high-precision equipment that meets all European and Belarusian standards and norms, as well as allows to supply clean and professionally purified water to homes and apartments of the population throughout the country, once again underlines that Culligan Corporation is satisfied with the state of the economic climate of Belarus and sees the possibility of implementing investment projects in our country.
For Belarus, Culligan's own production line for the production of high-tech equipment is an opportunity not only to provide the country with high-quality equipment and clean water, attract investment resources to the country's economy, but also an opportunity to give additional jobs to the population and increase the overall level of technical training of specialists.
In parallel, there was a discussion of commercial projects implemented by Culligan in the Republic of Belarus, equipment supplies for which are still coming from Italy.

Representative of the US State Department noted the positive dynamics of Belarusian-American relations
Culligan is far from the only corporation of American origin that operates on the territory of the Republic of Belarus. The warming of Belarusian-American relations may become a new vector for the development of business projects between the countries.
During the meeting between President of Belarus and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rubin in Minsk, the positive dynamics of relations between the two countries was noted.
"The meeting discussed topical issues of Belarusian-American relations, including those of a problematic nature. At the same time, the parties noted the recent positive dynamics of relations," the press service of the President informed.

Council of Ministers of Belarus - cooperation with Culligan Corporation
On June 10, Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus Anatoly Kalinin met with Vice President of Culligan Corporation Lawrence Bauer and the management of Culligan Bel LLC. During the meeting, issues of further cooperation on the development of modern production of water treatment equipment in Belarus using the latest technologies of water treatment and water treatment were discussed.
In particular, the possibility of attracting preferential loans from foreign banks by Culligan Corporation for the implementation of projects for the reconstruction and construction of water supply facilities in the republic was considered. On the Belarusian side, the agent bank will be JSC ”Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus“.8Совет Министров Беларуси

Lawrence Bauer informed that Culligan Corporation, in order to ensure the production, sale and maintenance of equipment of the Culligan trademark on the territory of the Eurasian Economic Union, created and registered LLC ”Culligan Eurasia“ with its head office in Minsk.
Anatoly Kalinin noted the interest of the Republic of Belarus in attracting investments and advanced technologies for the implementation of projects in the field of water supply and water treatment, as well as readiness to create the necessary conditions for the development of mutually beneficial cooperation, including on the principles of public-private partnership.
As a result of the meeting, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus instructed the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services to submit to the Government of the Republic of Belarus within ten days a plan for joint work with Culligan Corporation to create a production of water treatment equipment and implement specific projects to equip water supply facilities with equipment of this company with the involvement of loans from foreign banks for these purposes, as well as to sign an appropriate protocol of intent with Culligan Corporation.
Anatoly Kalinin intends to visit the production facilities of Culligan Bel LLC in Zaslavl in the near future and get acquainted with the production of water treatment equipment. The Deputy Prime Minister proposed to consider the possibility of localization of up to 60-70% of goods, works and services of Belarusian organizations in the production of such equipment, as well as to implement at the expense of own funds of LLC ”Culligan Bel“ a pilot project for the organization of water supply of the agro-town using equipment of its own production.
It is worth noting that the replacement and modernization of equipment at Belarusian enterprises is an important step that the country will take in the near future. The merit of Culligan Corporation in this process lies in the fact that the strategic work will reduce the financial burden on Belarusian enterprises by attracting investment resources from foreign banks.

Culligan equipment was installed at the Berezovsky Cheese Factory.
In August 2015, the company "Calligan Bel" completed the installation of degreasing and ultraviolet disinfection systems at the cheese factory in the city of Ivanovo. Culligan has chosen an ultra-compact solution.
The Berezovsky Cheese Factory originally had horizontal cantilever pumps that occupied the entire area. The new filters had to fit compactly on the territory of the plant and improve the water quality to European standards.
We have proposed a modern solution:
To place a de-ironing station in the present building of the plant, with the replacement of old pumps with a new energy-saving WILO pumping station with vertical motors with energy efficiency class IE3, and efficiency 93, 3%
The Berezovsky Cheese Plant (Ivanovo) now operates:

Culligan together with Tetra Pak will take care of the future of the planet
During the 21st century, the world's population has increased 3 times, while water consumption has increased 6 times. Experts predict that it is the lack of water that will affect the development of the entire food industry in the world. Water already plays an important role in the development of the world economy, the topic of water quality is directly related to the social level of the world's population. Guided by these data, the two manufacturers came to the need for joint development in the field of ecology.


Tetra Pak, one of the world market leaders in the production of food packaging, turned to Culligan to develop an individual solution. It was necessary to reduce the amount of water used in production. Thus, the water used by Tetra Pak for cooling was previously distributed continuously (10-30 l/min for each machine), worked at a high temperature (50 °), contained a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide and oils. A technological solution from Culligan, the Water Filtered Station (WFS) allowed the waste water to be reused, restoring 95-100% of the water. The station can also significantly reduce the content of oil and hydrogen peroxide in this water.


The development of the WFS system took three years, and field tests were also carried out during the year. As a result, the water filtration station has taken a worthy place among solutions that save water and protect the environment.

"Kobrin Butter and Cheese Factory" improves product quality and reduces costs with Culligan
In January 2015, the specialists of the company "Calligan Bel" installed and launched a degreasing station at the "Kobrin butter and cheese factory", with a capacity of 2,400 m3/ day. The service life of the filter loading at such Culligan stations is from 25 years, and the service life of filter housings with a patented polymer coating is more than 50 years.
An important advantage of Culligan filters for the Kobrin Butter and Cheese Factory was their compactness. The configuration of the filters and the peculiarity of their operation made it possible to place all the necessary equipment on the initial limited areas.
The plant has reduced the cost of additional personnel, since the filters work in automatic mode, and it has also been possible to significantly reduce the operating costs of water treatment.

Together with Culligan. Minsk will drink artesian water
One of the most modern water treatment plants in the post-Soviet space has started operating in Minsk. The Petrovshchyna station will provide drinking water to residents of the Grushevka microdistrict. Artesian water in Minsk residents' apartments will appear thanks to Culligan equipment. 
 
 imag1697 

By 2030, the Minsk City Executive Committee plans to completely transfer Minsk residents to centralized artesian water supply. But even artesian water requires purification, since the content of iron and other impurities in individual wells is increased. Culligan cleaning equipment allows to ensure that tap water can be drunk without additional filters and boiling.
The water treatment plant is located on Dzerzhinsky Avenue, almost in the center of Minsk. Therefore, a solution was needed that would allow the equipment to be placed on a small territory, as a result, it was possible to save the occupied area by 4 times. Technological developments have also minimized the volume of washing water. In addition, the reagentless technology of Culligan Super-Iron made it possible to purify water from iron and manganese in one stage, while similar systems operate in two stages of purification. The capacity of the Petrovshchyna water intake is almost 30 thousand m3/day.
There are no analogues of the de-ironing station in the entire territory of the post-Soviet space, delegations from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazakhstan are planning to study the experience of Minsk utilities.

"We invite Turkish investors to Belarus," Belarusian Head of State said at the expanded talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 


According to the Belarusian head of state, further development of mutually beneficial and balanced investment and credit-financial relations meets the interests of both countries. Belarus already has a number of examples of successful activities of Turkish investors in the field of construction, telecommunications, light industry, production of building materials. "However, we can safely say that we still have a significant untapped potential in this area," the Belarusian leader noted.
The President of Belarus proposed to think about the prospects of intensifying Belarusian-Turkish cooperation in the banking sector. "For our part, we are ready to support the establishment of a bank with Turkish capital in Belarus or the entry of a Turkish bank into the capital of one of the already operating Belarusian ones," the head of state said.
